3.Differnce between screen window and document in js


screen-The window.screen object contains information about the user's screen.

The methods are

screen.width
screen.height
screen.availWidth
screen.availHeight
screen.colorDepth
screen.pixelDepth
Window Since modern browsers have implemented (almost) the same methods and properties for JavaScript interactivity, it is often referred to, as methods and properties of the BOM.


The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's window.
All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.
Global variables are properties of the window object.
Global functions are methods of the window object.
Even the document object (of the HTML DOM) is a property of the window object:
ex.Window.innerwidth,widow.innerheight






3)document
he document object represents your web page.
If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object.
Below are some examples of how you can use the document object to access and manipulate HTML.


example
document.getElementById(id)
Find an element by element id
document.getElementsByTagName(name)
Find elements by tag name
document.getElementsByClassName(name)
Find elements by class name
